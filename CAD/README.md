*SolidWorks files:*

1. **...Rev0.sldprt** Starting design for generic IVC filter

2. **...Rev1.sldprt** Generic IVC filter following design revision and preliminary FEA analysis. This model needs to be revised now for manufacturing a prototype (adjust kerf, etc.).

3. **...Rev1.slddrw** Engineering drawing for the generic IVC filter.

>Kenny - Few comments about the CAD file. I reviewed the solidworks part file and the drawing. The as-cut configuration of the Solidworks file is recommended to be a flat pattern like Figures 2.14 and 2.35 of the open stent documentation by Craig. You need to account for material removal while creating this configuration. This flat pattern is needed for creating laser tooling path. After fixing as-cut configuration, you can create a separate dxf file on a 1:1 scale of this 2D skectch, i.e just the front face and save it separately. 

>The drawing pdf that you created is good and we need that as a reference while manufacturing, tooling and expansion process. Just mention whether those dimensions correspond to finished or as-cut, so it's better if you have as-cut in the first page followed by expanded/finished . Also please dimension the strut width and wall thickness.
