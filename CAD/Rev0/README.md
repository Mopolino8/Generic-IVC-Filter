**Files for initial generic IVC filter concept**

# Correspondence:

>Hi All,

>I just finished our first iteration (rev 0) of the generic IVC filter design. See the attached images. Here are the dimensions/characteristics of the initial design:

>• Maximum IVC diameter: 28 mm
>• Delivery via a 10 French (3.33 mm) catheter
>• Nitinol tubing: 3 mm OD, 0.5 mm wall thickness
>• Total length/height of filter: 50 mm
>• Hub length/height: 7 mm
>• Strut dimensions: approx. 0.5 mm x 0.5 mm (16 total struts)
>• Approximate length of contact with 28 mm vessel lumen: 7 mm
>•  No hooks

>The concept was to make the design relatively simple, but unique from the current filters on the market. The concept of having the legs flare out gradually is to distribute the stress/strain along the length of the strut and to provide a moderate amount of length of contact with the vein wall for centering and migration prevention. There are no hooks in the design. We can add them if we want, but I don’t think it’s necessary because we don’t need them for testing and it’s something we can add later.

>Please note that this is just the initial design (Rev 0) and I am hoping we can work together to improve and finalize the design. You are the experts on these devices, so by all means feel free to make any suggestions/revisions you think would help.

>Below are links to IGES files for the filter and a 28 mm mock IVC lumen (the maximum “indicated" diameter) that the filter is currently conformed to.

>Let me know if you have any questions and how we can proceed to finalize the design.

>Thanks!
