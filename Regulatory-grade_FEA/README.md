# Regulatory-grade FEA

*Placeholder for final, "regulatory-grade" FEA simulations*

Todo:
V&V:

1. Verification
  1. Code verification?
  2. Numerical verification (i.e., grid refinement study)
  3. Material model verification: in collaboration with Confluent Medical, 
    - obtain lot-specific nitinol material properties
    - fit constants to raw material testing data 
    
2. Validation
  1. Fatigue testing with sub-component model
    - same material processing history as prototype devices (e.g., heat treating and electropolishing)
  2. Other?
  
Generic IVCF FEA:
1. Sheathing (prestrain)
2. Placement (contact area/length/forces)
3. Valsalva (fatigue)
