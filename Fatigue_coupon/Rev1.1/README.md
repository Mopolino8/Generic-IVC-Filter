# Rev1.1 Fatigue Coupon

**Fatigue coupon corresponding to the Rev1.1 full device CAD model**

NOTES
-----
* The total length of the strut for the coupon is 16mm (versus 41mm for the full device); this allows us to operate the fatigue tests at a higher frequency
* The mean/amplitude strain point cloud for the coupon matches the point cloud for the full device relatively well (**quantify this**) with a prescrived tip displacement of 1.0mm
* The fatigue coupon design assumes the same amount of material removal for the finishing processes:
    * width: 0.025mm (i.e., 0.0125mm from each side)
    * thickness: **TBD; measure finished prototypes**
