***Figure 1:** Predicted strain amplitude versus number of elements through the height (thickness) / width of the strut. Simulations are performed using C3D8I (incompatible) elements.*

***Figure 2:** Predicted maximal strain amplitude versus stroke displacement for the low-strain fatigue coupon. The planned experimental conditions are also shown. Strain amplitude values are extracted from the fine case (i.e., 64 effective elements through the strut height/width) and are extrapolated to surface nodes.*
