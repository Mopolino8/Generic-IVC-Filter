# Preliminary FEA

*ABAQUS FEA simulation files*

1. **Input_Files/**   ABAQUS/Standard input files (includes mesh, material properties, boundary conditions, etc.)

2. **ABAQUS_CAE/**   ABAQUS/CAE files used to generate ABAQUS input

3. **Generic_IVC_filter_project_Preliminary_FEA_Summary.pdf**   Brief documentation of preliminary FEA simulation results


Simulations were performed using the same material constants for the ABAQUS Superelastic UMAT as those in  https://github.com/cbonsig/strain-amplitude-volume-fraction/blob/master/Abaqus_6.12-1_Example.inp
