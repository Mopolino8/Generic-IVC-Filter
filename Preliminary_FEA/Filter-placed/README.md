# Mesh for placed GIVCF

STL meshes for the generic IVC filter placed in a 28 mm-diameter circular vena cava model. 

Virtual filter placement was performed using nonlinear finite element analysis with nitinol material constants from experimental data (see material characterization folder). The vein model was approximated as rigid. 

Dimensions are mm.
